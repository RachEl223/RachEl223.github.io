    <h1>Check out the cool website</h1>
    <h2><a href:"http://wp.magnium-themes.com/hind/hind-1/">Hind Multi-Concept Creative WordPress Portfolio Theme</a></h2>
    <p> This website is a promotion site for a company of designers, so naturally the page shows some design skills. What interested me was the fact that their page was not only colorful and organized, but it was also welcoming and interactive. The homepage has an animation that moves in the opposite direction of where you move your mouse. The screen alternates between three different animations while each interacts in the same way, they each have their own design.</p>
